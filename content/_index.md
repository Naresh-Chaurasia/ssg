# Welcome to [Marcin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcin-misiak-70836aa4/)'s experimental website

This website was created to provide **samples** of my writing on technical content. It is **not** an exhaustive guide or a feature-packed documentation demo.

All commands provided literally in this guide and system configuration instructions assume the use of Ubuntu or a similar Linux distribution.

The guide includes the following sections, arranged in suggested reading order:
## [Hugo](/docs/hugo)
Instructions for creating a website with Hugo, an open-source static site generator.

## [GitHub](/docs/github)
Describes the basic concepts of Git and explains the first steps in GitHub, including account creation, authorization, and starting work with a repository.

## [GitHub Pages](/docs/deploy)
Explains how to publish the Hugo-generated website using the free GitHub Pages service.
